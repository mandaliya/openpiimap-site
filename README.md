# 🌍 OpenPIIMap Website

This is the official website for **OpenPIIMap** — an open-source initiative to map and standardize definitions of **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** and **Protected Health Information (PHI)** across global privacy frameworks like **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **DPDPB**.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and styled using Tailwind CSS, this site is optimized for SEO, contributor clarity, and long-term scalability.
